        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>this page is designed for the sole purpose of researching
            the 2026 steam hardware [namely the steam machine and steam frame]
            against one to two competitors of similar specifications,
            as well as to lock in the sentiments of the time
            when the steam hardware was announced to release day</p>
    </Section>
    <section>
        <h2>Scenerios</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>what are the steam hardware specs compaired to the competition?</p>
            <p>what is the price? [currently unavailable and will be coming in early 2026]</p>
            <p>what are the likely use-cases for the devices mentioned?</p>
            <p>what Technologies were used to complete the unique features of the devices?</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Color Schema </h2>
        <!--taking reference from the IRS government page
         because WCAG 2.2 doesn't account for ACTUAL color contrast...
         but for the test number contrast... 
         I can see many web-pages [steam 2026 hardware being an example] in
         Monochrome
         no Red
         no Green
         no Blue
         types of color blindness simulations
         by Both
         Firefox Accessibility Tab in Devtools
         AND
         WebAIM WAVE extension desaturation toggle
         
         
         You can tell I dislike this standard *merely* for the fact
         that it is:
         1. not easily testable with browsers AND the official extension past values...
          it ISN'T about the Actual Sight of a color-blind/visually-disabled person but a SCORECARD!
         2. makes me see only monochrome as an color schema option EVEN though it is about text clarity
         3. finally it basically makes EVERY webpage gaudy/disgusting. no exceptions.-->
        <p>Primary Color will be blue = #00599c</p>
        <p>#e4d6bf beige : image background</p>
        <p>Background Color will be white = #f9f9f9</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>text color will be presumably white, when paired with a blue backgrond</p>
        <p>else it will be black</p>

        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>I have made some wireframes and will pair them within this folder</p>
