                <h1>Steam 2026 Hardware Research Page</h1>
                <p>the reason for the name is to denote what its purpose is.
                    to understand the Steam Hardware rumors so far and to figure out 
                    as much about them in a fashion that allows for proper examination
                    of details of the Steam Hardware Release in 2026
                </p>
                </section>

                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>this page is designed for the sole purpose of researching
                    the 2026 steam hardware [namely the steam machine and steam frame]
                    against one to two competitors of similar specifications,
                    as well as to lock in the sentiments of the time
                    when the steam hardware was announced to release day</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Scenerios</h2>
                <p>what are the steam hardware specs compaired to the competition?</p>
                <p>what is the price? [currently unavailable and will be coming in early 2026]</p>
                <p>what are the likely use-cases for the devices mentioned?</p>
                <p>what Technologies were used to complete the unique features of the devices?</p>

                <h2>Color Schema </h2>
                <!--taking reference from the IRS government page
                because WCAG 2.2 doesn't account for ACTUAL color contrast...
                but for the test number contrast... 
                I can see many web-pages [steam 2026 hardware being an example] in
                Monochrome
                no Red
                no Green
                no Blue
                types of color blindness simulations
                by Both
                Firefox Accessibility Tab in Devtools
                AND
                WebAIM WAVE extension desaturation toggle


                You can tell I dislike this standard *merely* for the fact
                that it is:
                1. not easily testable with browsers AND the official extension past values...
                it ISN'T about the Actual Sight of a color-blind/visually-disabled person but a SCORECARD!
                2. makes me see only monochrome as an color schema option EVEN though it is about text clarity
                3. finally it basically makes EVERY webpage gaudy/disgusting. no exceptions.

                12/2/25 later learned more about said standard... wish web browsers were better equipped for them-->

                <p>I have made some wireframes and will pair them within this folder.
                    note color choice is for contrast and does NOT account for colors used.
